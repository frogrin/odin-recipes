    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Try this Detroit-style pizza recipe the next time you want a crunchy, 
      crispy, cheese-laden slice! Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish pizza, 
      but I don't think that accurately captures the essence of this crispy, 
      crusty, crazy-good pizza.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>pizza dough</li>
      <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>24 ounces shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package thick pepperoni slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper flakes, 
        and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. 
        Simmer for 15 minutes. 
      </li>
      <li> 
        Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C). 
        Combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into bowl. Toss lightly to mix together. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. 
        Scatter cheese evenly over top, making sure to fully cover 
        all the edges where dough meets the pan. 
      </li>
      <li>Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices over top.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, 
        about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.  
      </li>
      <li>
        Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into rectangular pieces.</li>
